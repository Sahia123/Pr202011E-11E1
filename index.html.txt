Spider-Man: No Way Home is a 2021 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics
 character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios and distributed by

 The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers.
 It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch,
 Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong,

 When the spell goes wrong, the multiverse is broken open which allows 
visitors from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe.
